# Data Exploration and Enrichment for Supervised Classification
In this project, the goal is to address a real data science use case from data cleaning and feature assessment to 
visual inspection and communication of results, using the Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) dataset. The HCC 
dataset was collected at the Coimbra Hospital and University Center (CHUC) in Portugal and contains real 
clinical data of patients diagnosed with HCC. So, we developed a machine learning 
pipeline capable of determining the survivability of patients at 1 year after diagnosis (e.g., “lives” or “dies”).

To analyse this file you should have a platform to open the Jupyter Notebook (you can find it online if you don't have one).
